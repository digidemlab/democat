quote: "Rubbish accumulates, not inside the park but on the road in front of it —
  just opposite my house! People just dump stuff from their car windows. \nI reported
  the eyesore, both on FixMyStreet and to Croydon Council. I believe that when reports
  are published online, the council may feel some kind of pressure and ashamed. The
  results have been good. Right now, the road is reasonably clean."

## What is it and why should I use it?

FixMyStreet makes it easy for anyone to report a problem without worrying about the correct authority to send it to. FixMyStreet takes care of that using the problem’s location and category, and sends a report to the department or body responsible for fixing it. Additional features are available for staff users working for the authorities who are actually fixing problems.

## How do I use it?

* Locate the problem on a map of the area
* Enter details of the problem
* We send it to the council on your behalf
