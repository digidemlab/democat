democatsays: The best ideas often come from the users, cats like you and me!
quote: It shows to me the value of being open. If the cities had the best 10 ideas
  from the beginning, there is no need to do something that is open, but the fact
  that the ideas are uploaded by users and scored, shows that there is something to
  be learnt by this process.
