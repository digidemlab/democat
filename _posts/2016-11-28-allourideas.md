## What is it and why should I use it?

All Our Ideas is an open survey tool created by the clever people at Princeton University. It’s very quick  and easy to set up and it allows any participant to add in their own ideas. It is a research project, so they might analyse your data, however they clearly state that in their policy that nothing will be passed on to third parties.

## How do I use it?


* Start with a question and some seed ideas, and you can create a survey in moments.
* The people you invite vote on ideas and add new ones.
* Discover the best ideas!
