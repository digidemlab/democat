## What is it and why should I use it?

The OpenSpending project is community-owned and community-run database and solution for exploring data, visualising it and getting involved with your community. Upload any kind of financial data to OpenSpending and explore it with their built-in interactive visualisations. Users are invited to get involved in loading data, developing the technology, doing analysis or writing news stories.

## How do I use it?

* Search for existing data sets
* Upload your own data set
* Model your data - so it can work with the visualisation software
* Visualise the data - Treemaps, pie charts, bar charts, geolocation, line charts, tables, you name it!
* Share and embed - any visualisation into your website, blog etc
