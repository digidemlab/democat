democatsays: Financial data isn't always fun, that's why the visualisation tools are
  so important.  What's not to like about a bubble tree?
quote: Data uploaded and visualized on OpenSpending was shared with the communityâ€™s
  leaders for review. This gave the community the opportunity to compare and contrast
  how planned budget allocation matched up with how funds were actually spent. The
  community leaders identified potential misuse of funds in some budgets lines and
  are continuing to conduct investigations and collect evidence to expose poor management
  of public finances in Kota Damansara, Malaysia.
