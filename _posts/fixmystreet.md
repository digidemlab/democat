## What is it and why should I use it?

FixMyStreet makes it easy for anyone to report a problem without worrying about the correct authority to send it to. FixMyStreet takes care of that using the problemâ€™s location and category, and sends a report to the department or body responsible for fixing it. Additional features are available for staff users working for the authorities who are actually fixing problems.
