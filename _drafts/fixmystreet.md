quote: "Rubbish accumulates, not inside the park but on the road in front of it —
  just opposite my house! People just dump stuff from their car windows. \nI reported
  the eyesore, both on FixMyStreet and to Croydon Council. I believe that when reports
  are published online, the council may feel some kind of pressure and ashamed. The
  results have been good. Right now, the road is reasonably clean."
